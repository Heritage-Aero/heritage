Issue donations feature defaults to disabled and the enableIssueDonation flag is set at deployment. Managed.sol Provides the contract owner with the means to add remove addresses from a list of managers. Provides the onlyManagers function modifier. DonationCore.sol Provides the business logic for creating, issuing and making donations. Tracks donation ownership using OpenZeppelin’s ERC721BasicToken.sol. ERC-721 Donation Mappings in DonationCore track each donation’s description, tax identifier, beneficiary, goal, and amount raised. A Donation struct containing the donation id, donation amount and original donor address is tracked as an ERC-721 asset. struct Donation { uint32 donationId; 4 bytes uint128 amount; 16 bytes address donor; 20 bytes }"

All donations made to this token will reference this donation id. struct Donation { uint32 donationId; 4 bytes uint128 amount; 16 bytes address donor; 20 bytes } Because the Donation struct stores the donation id as a 32-bit number the contracts impose a soft cap of 4,294,967,295 (2^32-1) donations. This allows for others to raise funds on behalf of the beneficiary and receive a recognition. Issuing Donations At deployment, the enableIssueDonation bool is set for the contract. If true, managers will have the ability to call the issueDonation function to create a symbolic donation. The symbolic donation can represent fiat, or other off-chain, donations. Symbolic donations may mint to a specific address. In the case of KYC’d fiat donations, the donor may provide an Ethereum address to attach to the symbolic donation. Symbolic donations are not minted and thus not tracked as ERC-721 assets. Deleting Donations At any time the owner may deleteDonation to zero-out the donation data in the smart contract."

Heritage will mint an ERC-721 donation for the amount of ETH sent by the sender’s address. The donor’s token will reference the donation id of the original donation token. Donation Chaining If a donation is sent to a donor token, or token that was not created by a manager, the donation is treated as if sent to the original donation token. However, the child token is recorded as having raised some ETH for the original donation token. This allows for others to raise funds on behalf of the beneficiary and receive a recognition. Proxy Donations To facilitate donations without requiring MetaMask we can launch a proxy contract for a donation. In the proxy contract payable fallback we call a function similar to makeDonation that credits the original sender address. Anyone may launch a proxy for any donation that does not already have a proxy. Proxy Donation Cons Exchange addresses credit exchange, not user (Exchange holds keys) Additional deployment gas cost (Small) Additional gas cost to create a donation"
