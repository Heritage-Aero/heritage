The Heritage smart contracts facilitate the creation, donation, and issuance of an asset based on the ERC-721 standard. Managers set by the contract owner define donations for a cause. Donors receive an ERC-721 receipt of donation to serve as a certificate or badge for their social impact. Managers may issue donations directly to an address to notarize fiat donations that occur off the blockchain.
